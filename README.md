# elementory-eezo
First prototype using modular RJ11 6p6c connectors. 
The Main board has the Arduino. 
The One board is designed to be used with the input, output, and display devices. 
Appropriate passive components must be chosen before soldering. 
Input devices compatible are Light sensor and knob. 
Output devices compatible are LEDs, Buzzer, and Servo. 
Display device is a 16x2 matrix LCD which uses I2C communication. 
The power is drawn from Arduino Nano or from the DC jack.
